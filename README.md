GitRap : Powerful discourse system running on top of Git/GitHub.
======

[![Code Now](https://friendco.de/widgets/image/codenow?url=https%3A%2F%2Fgithub.com%2FSamyPesse%2Fgitrap.git)](https://friendco.de/widgets/url/codenow?url=https%3A%2F%2Fgithub.com%2FSamyPesse%2Fgitrap.git)

GitRap allows you to store complete conversations with your collaborators into your GIT repository (into a specific branch named "gitrap").

This GitRap client runs in your browser (no backend needed) and use GitHub API to read/write data into the branch "gitrap" or yours repositories.
The concept of GitRap is not related to GitHub and can be used with any GIT repositories but not in this client-side application.
